                Shardeum aims to be a chain capable of onboarding over a billion people to the
                blockchain and crypto revolution. Shardeum, like the Internet, will be open,
                collaborative, and community-driven and would democratize accessibility to
                decentralization.
                <br />
                Shardeum will be the infrastructure on which the next iteration of the Internet, Web
                3, will be built that will truly seek to liberate masses in the years to come.

                Shardeum Liberty launches on 26th April 2022 where we will demonstrate how to deploy
                smart contracts and DApps on the network. Once Liberty is launched, you can start
                deploying smart contracts and DApps on the alphanet by following our developer
                documentation. Simultaneously, the network performance will be analyzed by the
                Shardeum Foundation’s dev team to identify improvement opportunities. You can
                further migrate Ethereum based DApps written in Solidity & Viper to Shardeum. An
                added bonus is you will never have to worry about rising gas fees again!

                Shardeum Liberty will be accessible to the public. You just need to configure the
                JSON-RPC server URL in MetaMask, Remix and other tools you use for development.

                here will be an ecosystem fund setup to reward devs for creating innovative apps on
                Shardeum. You would be able to apply for a grant. More information will be posted on
                the Shardeum.org site about the process to apply.

                Since Shardeum is EVM compatible, there is nothing new you have to learn to use the
                network. On a sharded blockchain, transactions which are EIP2930 compliant will run
                faster than regular transactions. So you might want to look into this. Information
                about creating EIP2930 transactions can be found under ‘Developer Docs’ link above.
